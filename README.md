# Meeting room booking
    #### Video Demo:  <URL HERE>
    #### Description:  A command-line program to book meetings rooms in an office building

## Project considerations
In this project I combined several of the skills from earlier submissions in the cource.
Keeping within the scope of CS50p, I used a 1-dimentional csv-file as data-storage instead of an database like Sqlite. So in this project the booking times are singular, instead od multiple, for each date pr. room.

## Using the program
The program startst with typing "python3 project.py" in the command-prompt.
This will display the "Meeting Room Booking" menu that opt for selecting a number value from the listed menu.
